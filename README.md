Beeraholic is your personal assistant for looking up your favorite beers.

Beeraholic is built over React and Redux for the frontend while Node.js (w / Express) and Redis were used to build the backend.

Beeraholic will help you find your favorite beer, search Beeraholic's huge directory with your favorite beer's name, creation date, IBU and ABV.
